# This is simple a implementation of RAG(Retrival Augmented Generation) technique using LangChain framework and Pinecone vector database.

## You need 2 API keys to properly run the jupyter notebook.
> Crete a .env file and paste your OpenAI API key and Pinecone API key
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "..."

PINECONE_API_KEY = "..."
```

## Make sure to store your PDF file that you want to embed within the same directory of the project.

### That's all thank you. :)
